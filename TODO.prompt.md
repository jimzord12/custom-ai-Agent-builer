Analyze the codebase and identify all instances where inline context definitions, technical stack references, design patterns, and naming conventions are directly embedded in the code. Replace these with standardized context chips from the approved registry system.

Key actions:

1. Search for inline definitions of:

   - Technical stack configurations
   - Design pattern implementations
   - Naming conventions
   - Context-specific terms

2. Document the location and usage of each identified instance
3. Replace each instance with the corresponding context chip from the registry
4. Verify that all replacements maintain functional equivalence
5. Ensure all new context references use the standardized registry format

Follow established documentation guidelines when implementing context chip replacements. Report any missing context definitions that need to be added to the registry system.
